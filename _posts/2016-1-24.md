title: Week of 24 Jan 2016
---

This marks the start of another grinding semester at the University of Texas at Austin. As always, I feel jealously and sorrow for students with easier majors.

Throughout the Spring, I am looking to learn as much about C++ and Object Oriented programming in this course. It will be the focal point and highest priority class of my semester. Having internship experience in one of the big four companies, I can attest to the importance of his methodologies. Most of the things he is teaching or forcing us to learn, are only seen in a real world development position and not in school. At this point in the program, it should be clear to everyone that school and industry are two very different beasts.

I spent the first week getting acclamated to the new semester in the usual manner -- being lazy. The beginning always feels like the calm before the storm. In all seriousness, I have been staying ahead on all assingments and readings, and intend to keep it that way. It's impossible to catch up after falling behind. Next week will be spent starting/finishing Colllatz and other assignments, as well as holding my office hours and discussion sections as a TA.

-**Tip of the Week**
Live like you know nothing. There are literally millions of people out there who know more and are better qualified -- try to get better every day.
